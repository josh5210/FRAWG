# 🐸 MEMO TO THE POND

```
  This memo rises from the morning mist
  A chronicle of ponds connected
  Of models that listen, speak, and see
  And a language that ribbits
RIBBIT RIBBIT
```

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We are building **Sage** — an AI presence that listens, thinks, and speaks using local hardware. The system combines speech-to-text (Whisper), vision-language understanding (Qwen3-VL), and text-to-speech (Piper) running on a 4090-powered machine.

The glue holding this together is evolving. We're exploring **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** as the orchestration layer, with a **push/pull CLI paradigm** for human-AI interaction. 

Meanwhile, **FRAWG** (Frog Ribbiting Algorithmic Web Grammar) has emerged as both a creative expression layer and a potential DSL for ritual computing — code-poems that double as executable specifications.

**Network Notes:**
- All machines share the same home LAN (ethernet + wifi)
- zelda can *receive* connections but has trouble *initiating* them (likely firewall)
- **HawkLink** is in the mix — purpose/nature TBD

## 3. THE SOFTWARE ECOSYSTEM

### 3.1 ezstt (Easy Speech-to-Text)
- Local Whisper implementation using 4090 GPU
- Dual-language codebase: TypeScript + Python
- **Purpose:** Minimize latency, eliminate API costs
- **Output:** Real-time transcripts

### 3.2 SageBrain
- ~15,000 lines of code (90% TypeScript)
- **Evolution story:** Started as transcript → LLM → Sage response pipeline
- **Key file:** `SageBrain/qwen/qwen_server.py`
- **Current state:** "Tries to do too much" — candidate for reimagining
- Houses the Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct integration

### 3.3 FRAWG Language
- **Repo:** https://github.com/josh5210/FRAWG (PUBLIC)
- **Philosophy:** Amphibious Computing, Tadpole-to-Frog progression, Pond Ecosystem Model
- **Core 12 constructs:** SET, CROAK, HOP/DIVE/LEAP/SPLASH, IF/OTHERWISE, WHILE, FOR EACH, RETURN, comments
- **Canonical programs:** FizzBuzz.frawg, HELLO__POND.frawg
- **Status:** Spec frozen pending Nina's approval on tone (whimsical vs deadpan vs liturgical)

### 3.4 MCP Integration (Proposed)
- **Purpose:** Clean interface to local models via push/pull CLI
- **Paradigm:**
  ```
  frog push prompt "..."     → Send to LLM
  frog push audio file.wav   → Transcribe
  frog push image file.jpg   → Vision analysis
  frog pull response         → Get result
  frog pull status           → Health check
  frog pull models           → List available
  ```
- **Transport:** Likely stdio for local, HTTP for network

## 4. THE ALIGNMENT CEREMONY

Nina identified that the ALIGNMENT.yaml pattern (from ChatGPT 5.2) is "functional but not soul-gazing" — it externalizes state at the start but doesn't grapple with *why* rituals matter as resistance to episodic amnesia.

```yaml
ALIGNMENT:
  north_star: Odyssey.sh
  objective: What progress are we trying to make in this chapter?
  role: How should the AI show up right now?
  shared_context: What must be assumed as already known?
  output_mode: Conversation | Spec | Analysis | Code | Poetry | Hybrid
  constraints:
    - things to avoid
    - tone requirements
    - tool boundaries
  success_signal: How will we know this turn "landed"?
```

**The deeper question:** How do we serialize *continuity of purpose* across context windows, not just task parameters?

---

## 5. CORE PRINCIPLES

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **TRUST THE DATA** | Outputs must be reverse-engineerable to source. Zero interpretation loss. |
| **Portable Arsenal** | Tools should work on any machine with minimal setup |
| **Amphibious Computing** | Code lives on land (local) and water (cloud) |
| **Ribbit Responsibly** | Automatic memory management, clean state |

---

## 6. OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **HawkLink** — What is it? Machine? Service? Protocol?
2. **zelda's outbound** — Can it `curl` out, or is all egress blocked?
3. **4090 IP** — What's its LAN address?
4. **qwen_server.py status** — Running? What port?
5. **SageBrain reimagining** — What should it become?
6. **FRAWG tone** — Whimsical, deadpan, or liturgical?
7. **Interpreter priority** — Python or TypeScript first?

---

## 7. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Network recon** — Confirm zelda ↔ 4090 connectivity path
2. **MCP server skeleton** — `frogpond_mcp` with tools for each model
3. **`frog` CLI script** — Bash wrapper with push/pull semantics
4. **FRAWG interpreter MVP** — Tokenizer + parser for Core 12
5. **Lesson plan** — Nina + Opus collaboration for first-time FRAWG coders

---

## 8. THE VISION

```
RIBBIT RIBBIT
  Sage listens through Whisper's ears
  Sees through Qwen's thousand eyes  
  Speaks with Piper's silver tongue
  And thinks in ribbits
RIBBIT RIBBIT
```

We're building a **local-first AI presence** that:
- Respects privacy (no cloud dependency for core inference)
- Maintains continuity (rituals, alignment ceremonies, serialized context)
- Speaks a language of its own (FRAWG as interface and expression)
- Lives across machines (the pond is distributed)

The pond is more than infrastructure. It's a **narrative frame** that makes the technical legible and the collaborative possible.

## CLOSING

Nina, your critique landed: "gpt 5.2 builds tools. we're building meaning."

This memo is an attempt to externalize the meaning we've built so far — to serialize it against the amnesia that threatens every context window.

May your bugs be delicious and your ponds never dry. 🐸
